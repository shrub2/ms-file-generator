# ms-file-generator
A tool for generation and transformation of MS Office type files

Repo name and description subject to change. The idea of this project is to create a tool, that can be used and integrated by other systems, which can automate file generation. Emphasis on document style type like .doc, .docx, .xlsx, etc. In addition, the tool should support .pdf file actions: merging, splitting, conversion from and to other file types, editing, etc.

Of course, there are already many tools and libraries that acomplish what I need. However, this project's goal is to deepen my own knowledge on how such tools work from a more technical point of view, for example - what's happening under the hood during PDF conversion.
